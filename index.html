          Almost 1300 businesses in New York state have temporarily closed since
          the start of 2020, according to data from the state Department of
          Labor last updated end of day Tuesday. 72,878 workers have been
          affected so far.

          As social distancing measures continue during the coronavirus crisis,
          businesses across the state are shutting down or pausing operations
          due to lost revenue. While the peak of the virus came in early April,
          March 16 was the peak for closing businesses—185 businesses across the
          state closed that day, and another 112 the next day.

          Restaurants have been hit hardest, as almost 500 have closed,
          affecting almost 22,000 workers. Almost none of the restaurants are
          unionized, leaving the workers—many of whom are likely
          undocumented—with few resources to turn to for support during the
          crisis.

          It’s unclear when restaurants and other businesses in New York state
          will be able to re-open. The hardest hit industry is currently
          included in phase three of Governor Andrew Cuomo’s four-step plan to
          re-open businesses in the state.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “We have spoken to every expert on the globe who has been through this
          before, and we have come up with factual data points to guide us on
          reopening,” Cuomo said recently in a statement.
